# New Alt 4

Ori13's idea to troll IOI for trying to prevent people from cheesing Hitman Freelancer mode

**NOTE: It is probably more convenient to just open Task Manager, then stop HITMAN3.exe. This program is just for fun.**

With that said:

## Setup Instructions

### EXE
- Wait until you have actually started up Hitman 3 before doing the below
- Better if you don't want to actually compile or install Python
- Open `dist` directory, then run `newalt4.exe`

### Python Compile
- Wait until you have actually started up Hitman 3 before doing the below
- Better if you want to edit the keybind etc
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- You do need Python installed... I have Python 3.8
- `python newalt4.exe`
